Before Starting to use pdf.php - Unzip the dompdf folder in this directory with pdf.php </br>
This folder should look alike, </br>

	/Vendor
	/composer.json
	/composer.lock
	/pdf.php
  
</br>
I used mPDF previously to get support to print Bangla and Unicode Fonts.</br>
DOmPDF is just lightweight, I'm using it again to print English and ANSI Fonts.</br>
